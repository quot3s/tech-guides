üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup - Getting Started with C/C++

C/C++ are foundational languages for system programming, games, and performance-critical apps. This section covers installing compilers, setting up IDEs, and compiling your first program.

Detailed Explanation:
GCC for C, G++ for C++. Clang is an alternative. Use CMake for builds. IDEs like VS Code or CLion aid development.

Multiple Code Examples:
1. Installation on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++
g++ --version
```
Explanation: Updates packages and installs G++ compiler. --version verifies installation.

2. Installation on Windows:
- Download MinGW from mingw.org
- Add bin to PATH
- Verify in cmd:
```cmd
g++ --version
```
Explanation: MinGW provides GCC for Windows. PATH allows command access.

3. Installation on macOS:
```bash
xcode-select --install
g++ --version
```
Explanation: Installs Command Line Tools, including G++.

4. Hello World (C++):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, C++!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation: Includes iostream, prints message, returns 0.

5. Compile and Run:
```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
```
Explanation: Compiles to executable, runs it.

6. C Version:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, C!\n");
    return 0;
}
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
```
Explanation: Similar for C using gcc.

Common Mistakes:
- Missing include directives.
- Wrong compiler (gcc for C++, g++ for C).
- Not setting PATH.
- Syntax errors in code.
- Ignoring compiler warnings.

Real-World Applications:
- System software.
- Embedded systems.
- Game engines.
- Performance apps.
- Libraries.

‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Tips:
‚Ä¢ Use official compilers.
‚Ä¢ Update regularly.
‚Ä¢ Compile with -Wall for warnings.
‚Ä¢ Test in sandbox.
‚Ä¢ Avoid insecure functions (e.g., gets).

üí° Pro Tips:
‚Ä¢ Use CMake for multi-platform builds.
‚Ä¢ Debug with gdb.
‚Ä¢ Use VS Code with C++ extension.
‚Ä¢ Compile with -std=c++17 for modern features.
‚Ä¢ Use make for build automation.

int count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
    std::cout << count << std::endl;
    count++;
}
```
Explanation: Loops while condition true.

5. Do-While:
```cpp
do {
    std::cout << count << std::endl;
    count++;
} while (count < 3);
```
